current task is to initialize object with set position and velocity

tried to use functional programming however need to use OOP for initial position 

- creating shader line 92 window.cpp / 19.42 Opengl ep7 (finish shader and hopefully animating will come up)
- updatePos not working, unsure atm
- apply gravity to triangle, apply tickrate timing independent from framerate
- see if I can display framerate

- need to create object with shader 
- animate manually (separate from physics.cpp)
- abstract object into class and create object every so many seconds at random position in screen

- consider using imgui as well for realtime debugging
